📋 Project Overview
Goal: Add AI chat functionality that can answer questions about your notes using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Architecture:
Rails API: Existing notes + new chat endpoints
LangChain Service: Python microservice for AI processing
Next.js Frontend: Existing UI + new chat interface
⏰ Timeline (8-10 hours)
Phase 1: Backend Setup (2 hours)
Phase 2: LangChain Service (3 hours)
Phase 3: Frontend Integration (2-3 hours)
Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (1 hour)

🏗️ Phase 1: Rails Backend Updates (2 hours)
Step 1.1: Add New Models
Step 1.2: Add Background Job
Step 1.3: Add Chat Controller
Step 1.4: Update Routes
Step 1.5: Add Required Gems

🤖 Phase 2: LangChain Service (3 hours)
Step 2.1: Create Python Service Directory
Step 2.2: Setup Python Environment
Step 2.3: Create Main Service File
Step 2.4: Create Environment File
Step 2.5: Create Startup Script

💻 Phase 3: Frontend Integration (2-3 hours)
Step 3.1: Update API Client
Step 3.2: Create Chat Components
Step 3.3: Create Chat Page
Step 3.4: Update Main Navigation

🚀 Phase 4: Launch & Test (1 hour)
Step 4.1: Start All Services
Step 4.2: Initial Setup
Add OpenAI API Key: Update langchain_service/.env with your OpenAI API key
Sync existing notes: Visit http://localhost:8000/sync_notes to populate the vector store
Test the flow:
Create some notes via the web interface
Go to /chat and ask questions about your notes
Step 4.3: Test Scenarios
Try these sample interactions:
"What notes do I have about work?"
"Summarize my personal notes"
"Find notes related to coding"
"What did I write about yesterday?"

🎯 Success Criteria
By end of day, you should have:
✅ AI chat interface that answers questions about your notes
✅ Source attribution showing which notes were referenced
✅ Conversation history
✅ Real-time embeddings for new notes
✅ Clean, responsive UI
🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

Common Issues:
CORS errors: Make sure all CORS settings are correct in Rails
OpenAI API: Ensure API key is set and has credits
Port conflicts: Make sure all services run on expected ports
Vector store: Run /sync_notes endpoint if chat returns no context
